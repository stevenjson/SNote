1.4 Measures of Variability
---------------------------

Examples
 * Standard Deviations
 * D = sqrt(D^2)
 * Range
 * Simple Varience

Sample Varience
_______________

Simple Varience *Definition in book pg. 36*

Proposition *See page 39*

Fourth Spread
_____________

f_s = upper fourth - lower fourth

You have 50% of your data inbetween the upper and lower fourths

Homework: Chpt 1.4 - 44, 51, 55, 58


2.1 Sample Spaces and Events
----------------------------

A *Sample Space* of an expirement is all of the possible outcomes for that expirement

An *Event* is a subset of all the possible outcomes

* A *Simple Event* has only one outcomes
* A *Compund Event* has multiple outcomes

2.2 Axioms of Probability
---------------------

 #. For any event, the probability is 0 or greater
 #. Total Probability is 1
 #. The sum of all events probability is 1
 
P(nullset) = 0

2.3 Counting Techniques
-----------------------
