Level 1 Fingerprints
--------------------

Class

 #. Arch / Tented Arch
 #. Whorl
 #. Left Loop
 #. Right Loop
 #. Double Loop

My fingerprints look like
-------------------------

Right
 * Thumb: Double Loop
 * Pointer: Whorl
 * Middle: Arch
 * Ring: Whorl
 * Pinkie: Arch
 
Left
 * Thumb: Arch
 * Pointer: Whorl
 * Middle: Arch
 * Ring: Whorl
 * Pinkie: Whorl

Verification System
-------------------

Give it a threshold to reach

EX: System has 3 samples, person gives 3 samples
 * 6 choose 2 = number of scores

Scores
______

Either Genuine score or Imposter score

*Genuine Score* compare samples from same identity

*Imposter Score* compare samples across identities

Genuine + Imposter = Total Number of Scores

From Example:
 * you can have 6 genuine and 9 imposter
 * You could have 12 genuine and 18 imposter

This depends on the matcher
 * Symmetric Matcher: A to B = B to A
 * Asymmetric Matcher: A to B may or may not be equal to B to A

Matchers
--------

EX:

Symmetric Matcher
 #. N identities
 #. m samples per identity

 * Number of Scores = NM choose 2
 * Number of Genuine = N x M choose 2
 * Number of Imposter = Number of Scores - Number of Genuine = N choose 2 x m^2
