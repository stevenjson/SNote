Iris Recognition
----------------

Daugman
+++++++

Developed an algorithm that could perform iris Recognition

"Father" of iris Recognition

3 parts
 * Segmentation
 * Normalization
 * Encoding

Anatomy
+++++++

Primary purpose of the iris is to regulate the light that enters the pupil

see magna notebook

Why is iris obtained in near infrared spectrum
 * Cant get textures from dark iris with visible light since melinan absorbs it
 * Iris reacts to visible light, and shrinks or grows, near IR does not affect the iris

Chaomorphagenesis - randomness of iris

Left and right iris are different from each other

Algorithm
+++++++++

How do we extract the iris from the ocular region?

see magna notebook
