===========

Image
-----

Image is a matrix

Each cell of a matrix is a pixel

RGB has 3 values in each cell (8 bits each value)

Gray has 1 value in each cell (8 bits for value)

GrayScale
_________

0 = black

255 = white

Also known as pixel intensity


Operations
----------

2 types of transformations
 * photometric - manipulating pixel intensity
 * gemetric - covered later on

 Operations List
 #. Filtering

      * photometric
      * implemeted with convolution
      * depends on filters/masks - also a matrix - tend to be 3 x 3 - can have negative numbers in matrix

         * For GreyScale:
         * multiply value with value it's over and add them all together - replace center value with value
         * move 1 pixel to right and repeat process for all pixels - pretend modified value is still old value
      * Edge Filters

 #. Gradient Operation
      * A difference in pixels

Edge Filters
------------

S_x == vertical gradient

S_y == horizontal gradient

S_x Matrix:

-1 0 1

-1 0 1

-1 0 1

S_y Matrix:

1 1 1

0 0 0

-1 -1 -1
