===========

Variance is sigma^2 Remember for quizzes.

Verification Errors
-------------------

Error Rates
___________

False Match Rate = (number of imp scores > eata) / number of imp scores = False Accept Rate

False NonMatch Rate = (number of gen scores < eata) / number of gen scores = False Reject Rate

Score Distrtibution
-------------------

Drawings for days. Check the book?

d-prime metric
--------------

Relationship between mean and varience

d-prime = abs(mui_gen - mui_imp) / sqrt((sigma^2_gen + sigma^2_imp) / 2)
