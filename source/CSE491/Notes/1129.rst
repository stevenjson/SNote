===========

EBGM
----

3 components 
 #. Fiduecial
 #. Gabor Jets
 #. Bunch Graphs

Training
--------

You have a face image

ignore ear and hair

uses fiducial points (aka landmark points) on the face, like corners of eyes, point of nose and mouth corners

Once we have the fiducial points
 #. construct gabor jets
      * use gabor filter
         * See magna notebook for equation

 #. Bunch Graphs
      * see magna notebook

 #. Face Bunch Graph
      * see magna notebook


Testing
-------

Each subject has a Face Bunch graph (FBG)

We have a test image

No bunch graph for test image, only has a face graph

See magna notebook


Texture Based
-------------

LBP
---

Takes an input face

Adjusts for the pixel intensity variations

Is a Photometric normalization

For grayscale images

See magna notebook
